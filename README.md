## Hi there, I'm Deyvid Holz and this is my secondary GitHub Account.

This my GitHub account for study purposes. You can find my main account [here](https://github.com/deyvidholz).

All the repositories in this GitHub account is related to study purposes projects, courses and things I learned. My idea is to have an extra GitHub account that has all my knowledge with repositories containing code or stuff written by me, so companies and others can check what I studied.

The code present in all courses repositories were written by me. I learn better by writing things by myself.

### Meaning of emojis in repositories' description:
- ✅ Finished
- 🚧 Studying
- 🔐 Not finished

If there is no emoji in repository description, it's probably a project.


### Things to be aware of:

- GitHub commit and push dates may be incorrect. If I find something that I learned long ago, I will add the year either in the repository title, description or readme file. For example, I learned Vue 2 in 2018, so if you see a repo for Vue 2, it's from 2018 (Wish I had this idea earlier).
